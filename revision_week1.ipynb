    "## Internal Working of python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is called an interpreted language. An **interpreter** is a kind of program that executes other programs. When you write `Python` programs , it converts source code written by the developer into intermediate language which is again translated into the native language / machine language that is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python code you write is compiled into **python bytecode**, which creates file with extension `.pyc or .pyo` . The bytecode compilation happened internally, and almost completely hidden from developer. Compilation is simply a translation step, and byte code is a lower-level, and platform-independent, representation of your source code. this **byte code** canâ€™t be understood by the CPU. So we need an interpreter called the **python virtual machine** to execute the byte codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Virtual Machine is the **runtime engine** of Python and it is always present as part of the Python system, and is the component that truly runs the Python scripts\n",

    "## Is python Compiled or Interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compiled languages** are written in a code that can be executed directly on a computer's processor. A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or \"code\" that a computer's processor uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An interpreted language** is any programming language that isn't already in \"machine code\" prior to runtime. Unlike compiled languages , an interpreted language's translation doesn't happen beforehand. Translation occurs at the same time as the program is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Python is **Interpreted**"
